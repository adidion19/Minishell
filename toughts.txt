type set for a complete env

a line is divided in sections

each section is delimited by a pipe, or by the end of the line

for each section, we have to define :
	- the input
	- the command - is it a homemade command ? or do we have to look in the path. I will not worry about that for now. just store the name of the command as a string
	- the options
	- the output - ? probably not needed
	- where to send the output

for example : cat test.txt | wc -l
	it has 2 sections

	the first section has : 
		input : "test.txt" as a string
		command : cat
		options : no option
		output : the result of the command cat 
		where to send : to the next section

	the second section had :
		input : what we received from the previous section
		command : wc
		options : l
		output : the result of the command wc
		where to send : the terminal

do we store the sections as a linked list ?
do we store the sections as an array ?

probably better as an array so it's easier to free


array of struct ! --> we need to know how many element we need at first

the parser receives a string.
it decides how many sections are needed
it allocate the right size
then for each section, the parser fill the section struct
at the end the parser return an allocated struct array
the array is null terminated

make a function to free the allocated array. do not forget to free each string inside of struct
